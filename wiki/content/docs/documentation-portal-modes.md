# Documentation portal modes

GenDocu automatically generates the documentation portal for each project. You can explore the documentation in the two modes.

## Newest view

`https://doc.gendocu.com/<organization>/api/<project-name>/`

The default view. It should be shared with the customers. It always presents the newest, latest project release.


## Build related view

`https://doc.gendocu.com/build/<build-id>`

The build view is only for the project maintainers. You shouldnâ€™t share it with the customer.
It presents multiple additional information related to a single build. The URL always presents the same information - related only to a single build.
